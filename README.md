# rice

[Moku Ken](https://github.com/MokuKen): Majority of this rice is his rice, mine is just a re-skin with gruv-box colors.

[Luke Smith](https://github.com/lukesmithxyz/st): I have incorporated his `st` terminal since it was something that was great and already out there.

[Eric Murphy's](https://github.com/ericmurphyxyz): His scripts and a few configuration have been adapted to this rice for a few added functionalities.
